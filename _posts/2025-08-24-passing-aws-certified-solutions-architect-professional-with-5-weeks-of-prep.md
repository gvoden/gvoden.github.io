### Passing AWS Certified Solutions Architect — Professional with 5 weeks of prep

I have been putting this off for a few years now. Back in 2019 I was early on to my AWS journey and set out to gain a lot of knowledge and hands on experience. I pushed myself to obtain the AWS Certified Developer Associate and AWS Certified DevOps Professional back to back. I did however fail the AWS Certified Solutions Architect — Professional. It felt like a test which was an exercise in fast reading and I was short of a few points to make the pass.

Now, fast forward to 2023. AWS has updated the exam and re-shuffled the domains: <https://tutorialsdojo.com/my-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-sap-c02-exam-experience/>. I set a goal to obtain this certification in the shortest amount of time possible. I have a family and kids, full time job, so time is of the essence. What inspired me was a video by Trevor Spires (@TrevSpires on Twitter). How to pass any IT certification exam. At first it seemed like marketing clickbait however his method is extremely effective, you can watch this here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6Xy1v2w1_M&t=45s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6Xy1v2w1_M&t=45s)

**TRAINING MATERIALS**

I had used Stephane Maarek’s courses in the past, he’s a super awesome AWS trainer on Udemy. I waited for him to update the course for SAP-C02 version and purchased it when it went on sale over the holidays ([https://www.udemy.com/share/102IMA3@Ys_iljCoGue0VJJu-Lk7pM4myij5cCq6SnxcBRTlUvq9iy6QBKN0ym1KwoIoBBU=)/](https://www.udemy.com/share/102IMA3@Ys_iljCoGue0VJJu-Lk7pM4myij5cCq6SnxcBRTlUvq9iy6QBKN0ym1KwoIoBBU=/). Note that Stephane’s approach assumes a few things — you are experienced in AWS and have sufficient hands on, and second, you are preparing for an exam and not looking to practice labs and fiddle with GUI or cli or write code. This was totally fine with me as I work with AWS daily and wanted to gain the breadth of architecture knowledge and how various services interact with one another to build solutions in the cloud.

The second set of materials was Tutorials Dojo practice exams — they’re by far the best for AWS exams, very detailed and written in the spirit of the real test with tons of explanations and graphics to help drive all the concepts home (<https://tutorialsdojo.com/>).

**STUDY STRATEGY**

  1. I watched Stephane’s course in its entirety over 1–2 weeks to gain the overall idea of what topics and architectures are being covered. I play his videos at 1.5 speed to save on time (it sounds silly but that’s how you save on time and can be super efficient)
  2. I took my first practice test from Tutorials Dojo and scored 65%. It felt encouraging after just a couple of weeks of study. I continued taking all 5 practice test to make sure I do well on time — I finished with 20 min left almost every time. I then would review all questions I got wrong, study the explanations and re-watch the Udemy videos on the specific topic. The above took about 2–3 weeks to complete.



**EXAM DAY**

I had booked the exam on a Saturday at 9am. I was up early and re-watched Stephane’s videos on several topics that I struggled with (AWS Batch, Storage Gateway and some of the Data/analytics services). I also focused on watching his architecture specific videos that teach you overall design patterns for a variety of scenarios.

I took the exam at a test center — I don’t want to stress over Internet connection issues at home or worrying that my cat may enter the room and ruin everything. I was very comfortable with the style of questions, reading fast and picking out key elements and details to understand what is being asked. Note that this is a reading comprehension exam that really tests your ability to pick out details about a solution and how it should be delivered and based on what requirements or priorities. Again, I was done 20 minutes earlier much like how I did on the practice tests. I was feeling more and more confident with each question so I didn’t bother marking any of them for review.

**RESULTS**

Pearson Vue tends to take extra time to review/score your test so you may not get your results immediately. I had to wait a full day, I believe this is due to a lot of concerns over people cheating on remotely proctored exams. That being said I got my Credly badge email early morning next day and then my results were recorded in my AWS certification account. One thing which is a bit of a bummer is, AWS does not offer the certification store benefit any more, I am not sure what the reason for that may be. However it felt great to earn this certification as a proof of my 5+ years of working with AWS and it’s also a great one for the resume or LinkedIn and of course, bragging rights.

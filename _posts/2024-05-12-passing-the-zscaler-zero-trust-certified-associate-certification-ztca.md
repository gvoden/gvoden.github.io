Hi folks, another certification success story here, this time it is the Zsclaer Zero Trust Certified Associate exam. I have joined a new team at my company and my role is shifting from DevSecOps to a InfoSec role where I get to use a variety of tools to protect my company and enterprise user community.

### About the certification

Zero Trust Certification Program was introduced recently by Raj Krishna (<https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-krishna/>) who is leading product management at Zscaler, some background can be found in this YouTube interview with him: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsuVpr8Kays&t=20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsuVpr8Kays&t=20s)

There is a gap in Zero Trust standards and common understanding of what Zero Trust is so Zscaler has taken this upon themselves to drive this by introducing this new certification. **NOTE:** This was initially called Zero Trust Certified Architect but has now been rebranded to Zero Trust Certified Associate and that is a bit of a bummer for those like me who are getting certified now vs when the cert was introduced.

Additional specifics about the cert and exam can be found here: <https://customer.zscaler.com/path/zero-trust-architect>

### Should you take this exam?

This all depends on whether you are working with Zscalerâ€™s ZIA/ZPA solutions. In my case, I am in a new role and there is a lack of skilled professionals on the team to operate this product, with the exception of a security architect who is the only person supporting this right now. Coming from a network security background it made perfect sense to me to get up to speed and use this certification as a structured learning path to become familiar with Zscaler ZIA/ZPA. I was also able to obtain a free exam code which covers the $300 exam fee. Alternatively if your company has purchased education credits as part of the Zscaler support contract you can leverage those towards your exam fee.

### Resources used to prepare:

My main resource to prepare was the Zscaler Academy which has a ton of really good free content for customers (not sure about non-customers):<https://customer.zscaler.com/page/zscaler-academy>

I completed the below learning paths comprised of video and text training from the Zscaler Academy as follows, it took about a weekend or to to clear:

### Taking the exam:

NOTE: This is a non-proctored multiple choice style exam that you can take from the comfort of your own home, and you have 2 hours to complete it. Zscaler also allows you to take it as many times as you want in order to pass. That being said, once you start the test you cannot pause it so you should be prepared enough in order to take it. There are 75 questions on the test.

This is a summary of my individual score:

The test is vendor agnostic and you will be tested on Zero Trust Exchange concepts as well as a lot of traditional network security technologies from the on prem days (VPN, datacenter, GRE, IPSec, site-to-site etc). This makes it a very good refresher of network security for the seasoned professionals, but also covering all the modern Zscaler network architecture concepts including Zero Trust, SSL Inspection, Identity, SAML, etc.

I would highly recommed this to anyone who is working with Zscaler whether being a customer or partner, it will help you solidify your understanding of what Zero Trust means and how it is implemented.

Finally, it feels great to get the Credly badge upon complition, certifying your knowledge on this subject matter:

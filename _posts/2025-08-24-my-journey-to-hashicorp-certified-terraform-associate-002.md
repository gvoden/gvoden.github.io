### My Journey to HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (002)

There is a lot of buzz around this certification which is not so new anymore. Back in 2021 my AWS DevOps team began moving away from CloudFormation in favor of Terraform for a couple of reasons:

  1. CloudFormation was becoming unwieldy even in its YAML version;
  2. Terraform was gaining critical mass as the go to tool for infrastructure-as-code beyond cloud but also supporting Kubernetes, networking and more. As a network security engineer coding was definitely not my forte so I set a stretch goal for myself to dive deep and learn as much as I can and get as much hands-on as possible.



### Certification prep

Hashicorp has a pretty good exam blueprint which outlines exactly what topics you need to be familiar with and to what level of detail (<https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate>). As a big fan of Day Two Cloud and Ned Bellavance, I subscribed to Ned’s Terraform Tuesdays YouTube channel which covered a lot of ground with hands-on examples and an amazing GitHub where I could fetch all the Terraform code. To top that, Ned has written an excellent exam guide for the certification which I procured right away to supplement my studies (link in reference below). I wasn’t planning on taking the test just yet as I was focused on absorbing all the concepts like Terraform state, providers, modules, functions etc. I was basically fully immersed into Terraform for 3–4 months daily at work and after work, watched all the videos, practiced deploying infrastructure in AWS and also locally. I then stumbled upon Derek Morgan and his More Than Certified Terraform course — by far the best Terraform instructor and DevOps evangelist. This course took me from a complete novice to intermediate with super helpful examples and being totally hands-on and covering all the developer concepts like variables, loops, interpolation, keeping your code DRY etc (DRY stands for Don’t Repeat Yourself).

### The exam

This is a 60 minute multiple choice test with some coding snippets and also Terraform core concepts. There are some Terraform Enterprise features that you are expected to know but they are not extremely emphasized. It’s only available as a remotely proctored exam meaning you cannot take it at a test center. It’s your typical remote exam experience where you need a clean desk with absolutely nothing on it or under it, just your laptop. From a technology perspective all you need to do is install a special browser provided by the testing company, so that’s pretty straightforward. I wasn’t going to just write the test without any exam prep — after all, having hands-on experience is not the same as taking a test. I used Bryan Krausen’s practice tests on Udemy, he’s a very respected Hashicorp instructor and author and his practice exams were extremely helpful. I was done in half the time, finishing in just 30 minutes and got my exam score immediately.
